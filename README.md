## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a web service that lets users play the [Bigtwo card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two).

This implementation has a few specific rules:
* The order of suits is Clubs < Spades < Hearts < Diamonds.
* Wraparound straights (e.g., A2345) do not count as 5 card hands.
